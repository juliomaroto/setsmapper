# Datasets Mapper

This project allows mapping certain entries of several datasets distributed in n csv files.

You can put yourself your own files at "data" dir of the project, and set them to the mapper through "conf/app.conf" configuration file.

The mapper is working by default reading the second field of csv input files, which is in this case a set of EEUU counties.
